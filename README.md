# Gilded Rose

## Task

Implemented code for `Conjured Mana Cake`.

## Running the Specs

To run the specs, you will need the RSpec gem. Open a terminal window,
and run the following command in the exercise directory:

    bundle install

You can run the specs from the exercise directory. Execute the
following command:

    rspec spec

To use the refactored gilded rose class set the environment variable REFACTORED_GILDED_ROSE to true with the following command:

    export REFACTORED_GILDED_ROSE=true

Then you can run the spec as defined above.

When finished, to permanently remove the environment variable simply run:

    unset REFACTORED_GILDED_ROSE
